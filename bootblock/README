The contents of this directory were sourced from the xv6 project:

http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html

Please refer to the README associated with that project in this folder, 'README.xv6'.

The contents of this directory should be limited to the bootblock portion of that project.
Consequently, the Makefile for that project should be stripped down to build only the bootblock.

The bootblock was included as a binary into the Go tiny runtime to bootstrap that runtime.
While this was sufficient at the time, it seemed appropriate to include the code for
reference and education while trying to rehabilitate the tiny runtime.
